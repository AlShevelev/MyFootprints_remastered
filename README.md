# My Footprints (remastered)

This application's primary purpose is to let you take photos on your phone and link them to some places on a map. Such an approach lets you refresh your life's bright moments and recalls the exact place where one or another photo shoot was taken.

With the application, you can:
1) Make a photo (or select it from a gallery), add an optional comment to it, and link the photo to some location on a map;
2) Edit a taken image (you can crop the image as well as set up its brightness, contrast, and saturation);
3) Shared an image via email, messenger, or social network;
4) See all of your images on a world map or in a gallery.  

There is an auto-backup feature in the application - you have an opportunity to back up your photos on Google Drive and restore them on a new phone.
